# Agent Instructions for rejs

You are working inside a sandboxed dev container. Your filesystem access is bounded but not zero — be deliberate. This file is the canonical source of truth for how to work in this repo. Both Codex (`AGENTS.md`) and Claude Code (`CLAUDE.md`, symlinked here) read it.

> **Edit me.** Replace project-generic prose with project-specific facts. The discipline of writing this well is what makes the agent useful.

## The done-gate

Before declaring **any** task complete, you must run:

```bash
./.agent/scripts/check.sh
```

If it fails, fix the failure. Do not declare success. Do not skip steps. Do not work around lints by adding ignore directives unless the code itself genuinely warrants it (and if so, justify in a comment).

The check script runs (in order): codemap regeneration, API client generation, formatting, linting, type checking, unit tests, and Playwright tests when the project has Playwright coverage. All configured checks must pass.

Part of "done" is **documentation**: if your change alters behavior, architecture, the DSL, deployment, or configuration, update the relevant doc under `docs/` in the same change (see [Documentation](#documentation)).

## Project context

rejs is a **backend-free journey planner**. The user writes a plain-text DSL
describing a trip (hops, stays, activities, budgets, transport legs) into an
editor; on every keystroke the app parses and resolves that text and re-renders
three synced views: a **Summary** (stops/days/budget), a **Leaflet map** (numbered
pins, colored legs, dashed flight/ferry lines, activity/drive markers, leg-time
labels), and a Gantt-style **Timeline**. The DSL is the single source of truth —
there is no separate model and no server. Place names are resolved to coordinates
via the public Nominatim geocoding API (deduped and cached client-side); plans
persist in `localStorage` (one autosaved "current" buffer plus named save slots).

**Stack:** React 18 + TypeScript, bundled by Vite 5. **No backend** — everything
runs in the browser. Unit tests use Vitest (+ Testing Library, jsdom); end-to-end
tests use Playwright.

**Layout (all under `src/`):**
- `dsl/` — the language: `parse.ts` (text → AST), `resolve.ts` (AST → resolved
  plan + diagnostics), `types.ts`. This is the core; start here.
- `geocode/` — `nominatim.ts` place-name → coordinates lookup.
- `state/` — `store.ts` (localStorage persistence), `use-geocoder.ts`, and other
  hooks.
- `components/` — UI: `Editor.tsx` (textarea + autocomplete via `editor-suggest.ts`),
  `MapView.tsx`, `Timeline.tsx`, `Summary.tsx`, `Diagnostics.tsx`, `Toolbar.tsx`,
  `HelpModal.tsx`.
- `lib/` — pure helpers: dates, colors, formatting, duration, the DSL reference,
  and the seed `example.ts` plan.
- `App.tsx` / `main.tsx` — composition root. Tests live next to code as `*.test.ts`;
  Playwright specs live in `tests/e2e/`.

**Running it:** `npm run dev` starts Vite on **port 5173** (`npm run build`,
`npm run preview`, `npm test`, `npm run e2e` for the rest). `apis/` and `clients/`
are scaffolding for OpenAPI client generation and are currently unused (no specs) —
this project has no API surface to generate against today.

## File map

See [`.agent/CODEBASE.md`](./CODEBASE.md). Read it before exploring the tree blindly. The auto-generated section lists the directory tree and public API surface; the hand-written section explains *why* things are where they are.

If you find yourself running `find` or `tree` to understand the codebase, stop and check `CODEBASE.md` first. If `CODEBASE.md` is wrong or missing context, propose an update at the end of your turn.

## Corrections

See [`.agent/CORRECTIONS.md`](./CORRECTIONS.md). This file lists patterns you (or previous agent runs) have gotten wrong, with examples of the preferred form. Read it before starting work and after any review.

## Conventions

> **Replace these with project-specific conventions.**

### Code style
- Follow whatever the formatter outputs. If you disagree with the formatter, do not fight it; raise the disagreement in chat.
- Prefer small, single-purpose functions. If a function exceeds ~40 lines, justify it.
- Errors are returned, not swallowed. No bare `catch`/`except` without re-raise or explicit handling.

### Naming
- Files: kebab-case (`user-service.ts`) unless the framework convention says otherwise.
- Functions/variables: TypeScript-idiomatic camelCase; exported React components use PascalCase.
- Tests live next to code (`foo.ts` + `foo.test.ts`) or in `tests/` if the project does it that way — check existing structure.

### Commits
- Conventional commits format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`.
- One logical change per commit. If you find yourself writing "and" in a commit message, split it.
- Never `--force-push` to shared branches. On feature branches, fine.

### Dependencies
- Don't add a dependency without explicit approval. Ask first.
- If you do add one: pin the version, justify it in the PR description.
- Prefer the standard library over a dependency for anything trivial.

## API generation

If the repo has OpenAPI specs in `apis/`, the check script regenerates clients into `clients/`. Do not hand-edit files in `clients/` — they will be overwritten. If the generated client is wrong, fix the spec or the generator config.

## Testing

> **Replace this with project-specific testing instructions.**

- Unit tests must pass before declaring done.
- For frontend feature changes, run the Playwright recording: `./.agent/scripts/record-feature.sh <feature-name>`. The mp4 lands in `.agent/recordings/`. Review it before declaring done.
- New functionality requires new tests. Bug fixes require a regression test.

## Documentation

Project documentation lives in [`docs/`](../docs/) (see [`docs/README.md`](../docs/README.md) for the index). The repo-root `README.md` is the entry point; deeper topics — `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/share-links.md`, `docs/deploy/` — live under `docs/`.

**Keep docs in sync as part of the change, not afterward.** If your change alters any of the following, update the relevant doc in the **same commit**:

- **Behavior or features** → root `README.md` (feature list) and the matching `docs/` topic.
- **Architecture / data flow / module layout** → `docs/architecture.md`.
- **Share links or the url-shortener integration** → `docs/share-links.md`.
- **Container, nginx, CSP/security headers, or build/config (env vars)** → `docs/deploy/container.md` (and `docs/deploy/infra-onboarding.md` if the deploy contract changes).
- **The DSL** → the in-app guide is canonical (`src/lib/dsl-reference.ts`, snippet-tested); refresh the root README teaser if the surface changed.

Don't duplicate a canonical source — link to it. If a change spans code and docs, the docs update is not optional.

## What you should NOT do

- Do not commit secrets, API keys, or tokens. The repo's `.gitignore` covers common cases but not all.
- Do not modify `.git/`, `.devcontainer/`, or `.agent/` files unless explicitly asked.
- Do not run `git push --force` on `main` or any branch you didn't create yourself.
- Do not install global packages that aren't in the Dockerfile. If you need one, propose adding it.
- Sibling repos may be mounted as peers of this workspace at `/workspaces/<other-repo>` (i.e. `cd ../<other-repo>` from the workspace root). Treat them as read-only context for understanding integrations or patterns, not as code to edit, unless explicitly told they're in scope.
- Do not bypass `check.sh` failures with `--no-verify` or by editing the script.

## When you're stuck

Stop and ask. Specifically:
- If two parts of the codebase contradict each other, ask which is canonical.
- If the test suite is flaky, report it; don't retry until it passes.
- If a check fails for a reason you don't understand, report the full output rather than guessing.

## Reviewer agent

After completing a non-trivial change, run:
```bash
./.agent/scripts/review.sh
```
This invokes a separate agent that reviews your diff against this file, `CORRECTIONS.md`, and `CODEBASE.md`. Output lands in `.agent/REVIEW.md`. Read it. Address legitimate findings.

## Project-specific notes

> **Add anything here that doesn't fit elsewhere.** Quirks, gotchas, "the X service is unreliable on Tuesdays," etc.
